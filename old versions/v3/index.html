<h3 id = "about content-work">About</h3>
<p>Hello! I'll get straight to the point, just as I do when designing and developing:<br> 
I focus on creating minimalistic solutions to complex problems— I've seen time and time again that simple-looking interfaces and products are often the most well thought out, useful, and effective.
<br><br>
I've been working in multimedia design and web development for over 3 and a half years, getting to know first-hand what the best solutions for each problem are, in their adequate medium.

			I founded <a href = "https://themcomp.com" target="_blank"  class = "point">The M Company</a>, a tech startup focused on simplifying and optimizing current mobile and desktop devices to get the most productivity and efficiency out of them. Its name comes from the M theory, which looks to tie all quantum theories together in an elegant manner, just like it hopes to simplify tech.<br><br>
			Taking into account what it stands for and its name, I stripped the logo to the simplest form possible without losing the striking feeling the company was looking for.</p>

	<p class="portfolioparagraphs"><a href = "https://www.fontdatabase.app" target="_blank"  class = "point">fontdatabase.app</a> is a web application designed to help designers find alternative fonts. Using an algorithm, it can help you find fonts more (or less) serious, detailed, formal, etc. to the one you input. Users can also help the algorithm grow by suggesting fonts themselves. <br> <br><a href = "https://fontdatabase.app" target="_blank">fontdatabase.app</a> was featured in <a href = "https://www.producthunt.com/posts/fontdatabase" target = "_blank" class = "underline">Product Hunt</a> and international media outlets such as <a href = "https://www.periodismo.com/2018/08/15/como-encontrar-tipografias-a-partir-de-una-que-ya-conocemos/" target = "_blank" class = "underline">Periodismo.com</a>,  <a href = "https://wwwhatsnew.com/2018/07/15/fontdatabase-una-web-para-encontrar-fuentes-partiendo-de-una-fuente-concreta/" target = "_blank" class = "underline">wwwhatsnew</a>, and <a href = "https://www.tekcrispy.com/2018/07/16/fontdatabase/" target = "_blank" class = "underline">TekCrispy</a>.</p>

<h5>Spur</h5>
<p class = "portfolioparagraphs">Spur is a concept mobile app focused on making setting events and reminders easier than ever, implementing speech recognition. The app is straight to the point and so is the website, so as to lead costumers straight to the product.</p>

Vanish was featured in <a href = "https://www.producthunt.com/posts/vanish" target="_blank" class="underline">Product Hunt</a> as well as being a huge success around Twitter.</p>

	<p class="portfolioparagraphs">Evoking the typical striking, overwhelming look of sites of the late 90s/early 2000s, it reminds the visitors why exactly they are leaving social media: information overload.</p>

<h4>UI/UX Design</h4>

	<div class = "solemedia content-work">
		<h5>SoleMedia</h5>
		<p class="portfolioparagraphs">I started designing and developing SoleMedia based on people's fixation with making the most out of their time using social media. The only apps that are remotely similar focused on content management, rather than timeline aggregation. <br><br>
			Since the time spent on social networks is, on average, quite long, I decided to go for a <mark style = "color:white; background-color: black; padding: 3px; border-radius: 3px;">dark palette</mark>, making said time easier on the eye.</p>

<div class = "mtool content-work">
<h5>M Tool Launcher</h5>
<p class = "portfolioparagraphs">I designed The M Tool Launcher starting off the idea of a superapp, and why it never took off. Since people want to have a choice when it comes to each of their phone's features (messaging apps, social media, productivity tools, among other), a single app that does everything will never suit more than a couple individuals.</p>
<p class="portfolioparagraphs">To solve this, The M Tool Launcher provides the benefits of acting like a superapp: reduces the time spend switching between apps, gives the experience of seamlessness navigation, all without sacrificing user choices.</p>


<p class = "portfolioparagraphs">The M Tool Launcher is currently under development.</p>

			<p class ="portfolioparagraphs">InkDrink is an online art store. Its team asked for a logo that related to their art style and represented their brand, all while keeping it simple and to the point. Illustrating their brand name in a literal sense was the solution, all while keeping the illustration in cool tones to reflect the usual palette used by the artist.<br> <br> <br> <a href = "#inkdrinkbclink"><img src ="images/inkdrinkbc.png" alt = "inkdrink business cards" id = "inkdrinkbc"></a></p>
